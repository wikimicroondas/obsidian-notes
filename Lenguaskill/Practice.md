### To write a formal email
**Contexto:** Eres un estudiante de DAM. Te has inscrito en un curso online avanzado de Java que costaba 300€.
- **Problema:** El temario prometía "Spring Boot Avanzado", pero los vídeos son de nivel básico y el audio es terrible.
- **Objetivo:** Escribe un email al director de la academia pidiendo que te devuelvan el dinero (refund).

Dear **Sir or Madam**,

I am **writing** to express **my** dissatisfaction with the online course I purchased from your platform last week. As a student of Multi-platform Application Development, I was looking for professional material to study from home.

**However**, the course has failed to meet the advertised standards. Considering the price of 300 euros, the fact that the syllabus does not **delve into** core functions is unacceptable. **Furthermore**, the audio quality is extremely poor, making the lectures difficult to follow.

**Had I known** that the content was so basic, **I would never have enrolled** in this course. It is clearly misleading to label this material as "Advanced".

**Therefore**, I request a full refund of my payment. **I look forward to** hearing from you within the next few days.

**Yours faithfully**,

Alejandro
